This miniature sizing ensures that even the youngest Jordan collectors can still enjoy the classic look of the silhouette.

Other details traditional to the Jordan 12 include the pebbled basketball texture on the toe panels, the plastic Jumpman tab at the midfoot, and a branded heel tab with the statement: “Quality Inspired By The Greatest Player Ever.</p><ul><ol>Full-grain leather or synthetic upper.

This “SE” version of the Jordan 1 Mid is constructed in premium materials including full-grain leather, suede, nubuck, textiles, and/or patent leather with limited edition colorways.
